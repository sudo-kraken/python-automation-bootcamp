# Practice Exercise: Build Your Own Final Project Review and Roadmap Tool

## Objective
Enhance the final project review tool by adding extra features.

## Tasks
1. Open the `final_review.py` script.
2. Modify the script to include an additional reflection field (for example, "Lessons Learned").
3. Adjust the output formatâ€”for instance, add separators or headings for clarity.
4. Run your updated script and verify that the log file records your complete review.
