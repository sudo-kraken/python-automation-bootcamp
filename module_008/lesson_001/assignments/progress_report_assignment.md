# Practice Exercise: Create and Enhance Your Progress Report Tool

## Objective
Practice building your own continuous improvement tool by extending the progress report script.

## Tasks
1. Open the `progress_report.py` script.
2. Modify the script to add an extra field (e.g., "Lessons Learned") to each log entry.
3. Change the log file name to something unique if desired.
4. Run your updated script and observe the log file to ensure your modifications are recorded.

Work through this exercise to become comfortable with interactive input and file logging in Python.
