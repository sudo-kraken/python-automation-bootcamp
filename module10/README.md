# Module 10: Bootcamp Graduation & Career Development

Welcome to Module 10! In this final module, you'll consolidate your learning and prepare for your professional journey. This module covers two key areas:

1. **Final Reflection and Graduation:**  
   Reflect on your bootcamp journey by recording your achievements, challenges, and lessons learned. You will use an interactive script that logs your input to a file and then opens it for review.

2. **Career and Professional Development:**  
   Plan your next steps by outlining your current skills, areas for improvement, and short- and long-term career goals. An interactive tool will prompt you for these details, log them to a file, and display your career plan.

Each lesson includes detailed explanations, demonstration scripts that execute real actions, and practice exercises for you to modify and extend as you grow your skills.
