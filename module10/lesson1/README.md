# Lesson 1: Final Reflection and Graduation

## Overview
This lesson helps you reflect on your bootcamp journey. Youâ€™ll record:
- Your overall journey and accomplishments.
- Challenges you encountered.
- Lessons learned and areas for improvement.

The demonstration script uses real file I/O to log your reflections with timestamps and then opens the log file for review using a system command.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Reflection Process:**  
  You are prompted to enter your thoughts on your project and learning journey. These inputs are logged into a file (e.g., `final_reflection.log`) with timestamps.
  
- **Reviewing the Reflection:**  
  After you finish entering your responses, the script uses a system command to open the log file with your default text editor. This simulates how you might review your documented reflections before graduation.

## Objectives
- Build an interactive reflection tool.
- Learn how to use file I/O to record and review your reflections.
- Understand the importance of self-assessment before graduation.

## Instructions
1. Read the explanation above.
2. Run the `final_reflection.py` script to experience the interactive reflection session.
3. Experiment with modifying the script by adding extra reflection fields (e.g., "Key Accomplishments") or changing the log format.
