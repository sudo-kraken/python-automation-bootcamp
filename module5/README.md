# Module 5: Knowledge Assessment & Practical Challenge

Welcome to Module 5! In this module, you'll both review the concepts you've learned so far and put them all together in a practical challenge. This module is divided into two parts:

1. **Knowledge Assessment Quiz:**  
   An interactive quiz that tests your understanding of key Python and automation concepts. You'll answer questions using the keyboard, and the script will check your responses in real time.

2. **Practical Challenge:**  
   A hands-on project where you integrate various techniques—interactive input, API data retrieval, and network automation—into one script. This script lets you choose between fetching live data from an API or executing a network command via Netmiko (using simulation if you do not have access to a real device).

Each lesson contains detailed explanations, demonstration scripts that execute real actions, and a practice exercise so you can experiment and learn by doing.
