# Module 1: Introduction to Python & Automation Fundamentals

Welcome to Module 1! This module marks the beginning of your journey into Python programming and basic automation. You will learn the foundational elements of Python—including writing scripts, using data types, controlling program flow, creating functions, performing file operations—and receive an introduction to applying automation in a networking context.

**What You’ll Learn:**

1. **Getting Started with Python:**  
   - Understand what Python is, why it’s popular, and how to run your first script.
   - Learn the basic syntax and structure of a Python program.

2. **Python Data Types, Variables & Basic Operations:**  
   - Discover the various data types (strings, numbers, booleans) and how to store them in variables.
   - Perform arithmetic operations and explore simple data manipulation.

3. **Control Structures – Conditionals and Loops:**  
   - Learn how to make decisions using conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
   - Use loops (`for` and `while`) to repeat tasks and process data.

4. **Functions, Modules and Code Organisation:**  
   - Understand how to write reusable code using functions.
   - Organise your code into modules for better structure and maintainability.

5. **File Operations and Simple Automation Tasks:**  
   - Master the basics of file input/output (I/O) to read from and write to files.
   - Use error handling to deal with common file-related issues.

6. **Introduction to Automation Concepts in Networking:**  
   - Get an overview of how Python can be used to automate network tasks.
   - Learn about best practices when using libraries such as Netmiko (with the note that actual device access is required for real execution).

Each lesson includes a detailed explanation, a demonstration script to run, and a practice exercise for you to work through at your own pace.
