# Lesson 1: Getting Started with Python

## Overview
This lesson introduces you to Python, a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. You will learn:

- **What Python Is:**  
  Python is an interpreted language used for everything from simple scripts to complex applications. Its clear syntax makes it ideal for beginners.

- **What a Script Is:**  
  A script is a file containing Python code that performs a series of tasks. You will write your first simple script.
