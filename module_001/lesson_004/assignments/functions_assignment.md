# Practice Exercise: Functions and Code Organisation

## Objective
Practice writing your own functions and organising them into modules.

## Tasks
1. Create a new file named `utilities.py`.
2. In `utilities.py`, define at least three functions:
   - A function to check if a given number is prime.
   - A function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers.
   - A function to reverse a string.
3. Create another file named `test_utilities.py` where you import your functions from `utilities.py` and call them to verify they work as expected.
4. Experiment by modifying and extending your functions to improve their functionality.

This exercise will help you understand the benefits of modular, reusable code.
