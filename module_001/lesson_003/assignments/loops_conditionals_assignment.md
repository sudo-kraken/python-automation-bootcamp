# Practice Exercise: Conditionals and Loops

## Objective
Practice using conditional statements and loops to control the flow of your program.

## Tasks
1. Create a new file named `control_exercise.py`.
2. Write a script that:
   - Prompts the user to enter a number.
   - Uses an `if` statement to determine if the number is positive, negative, or zero, and prints an appropriate message.
   - Uses a `for` loop to print the multiplication table of the entered number (from 1 to 10).
   - Uses a `while` loop to count down from the entered number to 1, printing each number.
3. Experiment with different inputs to observe how the control structures behave.

This exercise will help you understand and practice decision-making and iterative processes in Python.
