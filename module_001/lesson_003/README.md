# Lesson 3: Control Structures â€“ Conditionals and Loops

## Overview
Control structures allow your programs to make decisions and repeat actions. In this lesson, you will learn about:

- **Conditionals:**  
  Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to execute code based on certain conditions.

- **Loops:**  
  Using `for` and `while` loops to repeat tasks multiple times.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Conditionals:**  
  Conditionals let your program decide which block of code to run based on whether a condition is True or False. For example, you can check if a number is even or odd.

- **Loops:**  
  Loops are used for iterating over sequences (like lists or ranges) or repeating a block of code until a condition is met. The `for` loop is useful when you know the number of iterations, while the `while` loop continues until a condition becomes False.

## Objectives
- Learn to write conditional statements to handle decision-making in code.
- Understand how to use loops to iterate and perform repetitive tasks.
- Develop a script that takes user input and processes it with conditionals and loops.

## Instructions
1. Read through the explanation above.
2. Run the `control_structures.py` example to see conditionals and loops in action.
3. Practice by writing your own script that uses both conditionals and loops.
