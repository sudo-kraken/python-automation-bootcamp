# Practice Exercise: Explore Network Automation Concepts

## Objective
Practice creating a network automation script using Python and Netmiko. This exercise is designed to help you understand the structure of such scripts. If you don't have access to a real network device, you can simulate the process by using the provided example as a template.

## Tasks
1. Create a new file named `network_automation_practice.py`.
2. Write a script that:
   - Defines a function to simulate sending a command to a network device. You may use the structure from the example above.
   - Optionally, include a mode that, if enabled, attempts a real connection using Netmiko (with your device details). Otherwise, print a simulated response.
3. Experiment by changing the command and device details (or simulated responses) to explore how automation might work.

This exercise is for practiceâ€”work through it to gain familiarity with network automation concepts.
