# Lesson 6: Introduction to Automation Concepts in Networking

## Overview
Automation can significantly improve network management by reducing repetitive manual tasks. In this lesson, you will learn how Python scripts can be used to automate network tasks using libraries such as Netmiko.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Network Automation:**  
  Automating routine tasks like retrieving device configurations or executing standard commands can save time and reduce errors.
  
- **Using Netmiko:**  
  Netmiko is a Python library that simplifies SSH connections to network devices. In this demonstration, the script uses placeholder device details. For actual automation, replace these with real device information and credentials.

**Best Practices:**  
- Always use try/except blocks to handle connection errors.
- Securely manage device credentials.
- Use logging to record command outputs and errors.

## Objectives
- Understand the basic structure of a network automation script.
- Learn how to use Netmiko to connect to a network device and execute a command.
- Recognise that this example is a demonstration; real execution requires actual devices.

## Instructions
1. Read the explanation above.
2. Run the `automation_example.py` example to see how a network automation task might be structured.
3. Practice by modifying the script:
   - Change the command or add additional commands.
   - If you have access to a network device, replace the placeholder values with real ones.
