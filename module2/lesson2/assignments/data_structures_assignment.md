# Practice Exercise: Exploring Data Structures

## Objective
Practice creating and manipulating Pythonâ€™s core data structures.

## Tasks
1. Create a new file named `data_structures_exercise.py`.
2. In your script:
   - Create a list of your favorite programming languages (include some duplicates).
   - Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates, then convert it back to a list.
   - Create a dictionary that maps each language to a brief description (or reason you like it).
   - Print the dictionary in a readable format.
3. Experiment with modifying the list and dictionary to understand how these structures work.

This exercise will help you become familiar with lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
