# Module 2: Practical Python Programming & Problem Solving

Welcome to Module 2! In this module, you will build on your foundational Python skills by learning practical programming techniques and solving real-world problems. The module is divided into three lessons:

1. **Interactive Python and Exception Handling:**  
   Learn how to interact with users via the command line, gather input, and gracefully handle errors using try/except blocks.

2. **Data Structures – Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries:**  
   Discover Python’s core data structures. Learn how to create and manipulate lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, which are essential for organizing data in your programs.

3. **Building a Command-Line Utility:**  
   Learn how to design and build a simple command-line utility using the argparse module. This lesson covers how to process command-line arguments and create useful, interactive tools.

Each lesson provides detailed explanations, demonstration scripts that follow best practices, and a practice exercise for you to learn by doing.
