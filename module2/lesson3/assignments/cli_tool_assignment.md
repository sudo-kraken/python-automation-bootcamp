# Practice Exercise: Command-Line Utility

## Objective
Build your own command-line utility using Python's argparse module.

## Tasks
1. Create a new file named `cli_tool_exercise.py`.
2. In your script:
   - Use argparse to accept at least two command-line arguments (for example, a name and an integer value).
   - Based on the input, perform a simple operation such as printing a customized message or performing a calculation.
   - Ensure your script includes a help message that explains how to use it.
3. Experiment with different argument values to see how your script behaves.

This exercise will help you learn how to process command-line arguments and build interactive terminal-based applications.
