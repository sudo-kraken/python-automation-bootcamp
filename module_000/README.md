# Module 0: Pre-requisites and Essentials

Welcome to Module 0! Before diving into Python programming and automation, it’s essential to set up your development environment and learn some core practices. In this module, you'll explore:

- **Python Environments and Virtualisation:**  
  Understand why it’s important to isolate your project’s dependencies using tools like **venv** (Python’s built-in virtual environment tool) and **pyenv** (to manage multiple Python versions). These tools help prevent conflicts between projects and ensure that your code runs with the right Python version.

- **Package Management with pip:**  
  Learn what a **library** is—a collection of pre-written code that extends Python’s functionality—and how to use **pip**, the package installer, to download and manage these libraries.

- **Coding Standards and Linting:**  
  Discover the importance of writing clean, readable code by following **PEP8**, Python’s style guide. You’ll also learn how to use **flake8** to automatically check your code for style issues.

This module is designed for beginners. Each lesson provides explanations and practical exercises to help you build a strong foundation.
