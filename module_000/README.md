# Module 0: Pre-requisites and Essentials

Welcome to Module 0! Before diving into Python programming and automation, it’s essential to set up your development environment and learn some core practices. In this module, you'll explore:

- **Python Environments and Virtualisation:**  
  Understand why it's important to isolate your project's dependencies using tools like **venv** (Python's built-in virtual environment tool) and **pyenv** (to manage multiple Python versions). These tools help prevent conflicts between projects and ensure that your code runs with the right Python version.

  **Pyenv** is particularly important as it allows you to:
  - Install and manage multiple Python versions on your system
  - Switch between different Python versions globally or per project
  - Isolate dependencies to prevent conflicts between applications
  - Ensure consistent development environments across different machines

- **Package Management with pip:**  
  Learn what a **library** is—a collection of pre-written code that extends Python’s functionality—and how to use **pip**, the package installer, to download and manage these libraries.

- **Coding Standards and Linting:**  
  Discover the importance of writing clean, readable code by following **PEP8**, Python’s style guide. You’ll also learn how to use **flake8** to automatically check your code for style issues.

This module is designed for beginners. Each lesson provides explanations and practical exercises to help you build a strong foundation.

## How to Use This Module

For the best learning experience, please follow these steps for each lesson:

1. **Read All Documentation First**: Start by reading the README files in each lesson folder to understand the concepts before running any scripts.

2. **Examine Example Scripts**: Take time to open and read the Python scripts in the examples folder to understand what they're doing - the scripts automate the processes described in the lesson, but reviewing the code will help you understand how they work.

3. **Complete Assignments**: Follow the instructions in the assignments folder for hands-on practice with the concepts.

4. **Refer to Reference Materials**: Check the additional reference materials provided for deeper understanding.

This approach will ensure you understand both what each tool does and how the example scripts demonstrate these concepts in action.
