# Practice Exercise: pip Package Management

## Objective
Practice using pip to manage Python libraries within your virtual environment.

## Tasks
1. **Activate Your Virtual Environment:**  
   Ensure your virtual environment (created in Lesson 1) is active.

2. **Install a Library:**  
   - Choose a simple library, for example, `requests`.
   - Run:  
     `pip install requests`

3. **List Installed Packages:**  
   - Run `pip freeze` in your terminal.
   - Redirect the output to a file with:  
     `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
   - Open the `requirements.txt` file to see the list of installed packages.

4. **Experiment:**  
   - Optionally, try upgrading the package:  
     `pip install --upgrade requests`
   - Or uninstall it with:  
     `pip uninstall requests`

Work through these commands to become familiar with managing libraries in your Python projects.
