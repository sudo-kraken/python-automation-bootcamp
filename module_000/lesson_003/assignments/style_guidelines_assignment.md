# Practice Exercise: Code Style and Linting with flake8

## Objective
Learn how to use flake8 to check your Python code for PEP8 style issues and practice resolving them.

## Tasks
1. **Install flake8 (if not already installed):**  
   In your activated virtual environment, run:
   ```py
   pip install flake8
   ```

2. **Run the Demonstration Script:**  
Execute the `pep8_flake8_setup.py` script to see how flake8 checks a file for style issues.

3. **Practice on Your Own:**  
- Choose one of your Python scripts or create a new file with some deliberate style issues.
- Run flake8 on the file from the command line:
  ```
  flake8 your_script.py
  ```
- Review the output and try to fix the reported issues according to PEP8 guidelines.

Work through this exercise to become comfortable with using flake8 and understanding PEP8 recommendations.
