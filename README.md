- **Module 1:** Introduces Python basics and simple automation concepts.
- **Module 2:** Focuses on practical programming and problem-solving techniques.
- **Module 3:** Teaches you how to interface with APIs and automate network tasks.
- **Module 4:** Explores how DevOps and NetOps practices are integrated through automation tools.
- **Module 5:** Provides a knowledge assessment quiz and a practical challenge to consolidate your learning.
- **Module 6:** Introduces AI development tools and simulates AI-assisted coding.
- **Module 7:** Guides you through advanced projects and mentorship-style collaborative improvements.
- **Module 8:** Focuses on self-review, feedback, and continuous improvement strategies.
- **Module 9:** Covers deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting techniques.
- **Module 10:** Helps you reflect on your journey and plan your career development post-bootcamp.
