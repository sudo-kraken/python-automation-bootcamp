# Lesson 2: Career and Professional Development

## Overview
This lesson guides you through planning your professional development after the bootcamp. You will:
- Reflect on the skills youâ€™ve acquired.
- Identify areas for improvement.
- Set both short-term and long-term career goals.

The demonstration script interacts with you, logs your responses to a file (e.g., `career_development.log`), and opens the file for review.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Career Reflection:**  
  You will be prompted to list your key skills, desired improvements, and career goals.
  
- **File Logging:**  
  Your responses are saved with timestamps to create a career development plan document.
  
- **Review Process:**  
  The script uses a system command to open the document for immediate review, simulating the process of updating your professional portfolio.

## Objectives
- Build an interactive career development planning tool.
- Learn to use file I/O for documenting your career goals.
- Understand how to articulate a clear plan for professional growth.

## Instructions
1. Read the explanation above.
2. Run the `career_development.py` script to start the interactive session.
3. Experiment by modifying the script to include additional fields or change the output format.
