# Lesson 2: Final Project Review and Next Steps

## Overview
Reflecting on your project and planning your future steps is critical to ongoing growth. In this lesson, you will:
- Reflect on the strengths, weaknesses, and overall performance of your project.
- Outline specific next steps and goals for continued improvement.
- Log your reflections to a file using real file I/O operations.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Final Review:**  
  You will be prompted to enter your thoughts on what went well, what could be improved, and what your next steps are.
  
- **Future Roadmap:**  
  By recording your reflections, you create a document that you can refer back to as you plan future work.
  
- **File Logging:**  
  The script writes your final review to a file (e.g., `final_review.log`) and then displays the content for immediate feedback.

## Objectives
- Build a tool for final project review and planning.
- Learn to use Python for interactive input and file logging.
- Understand how to articulate a clear roadmap for future growth.

## Instructions
1. Read the explanation above.
2. Run the `final_review.py` script to simulate a final project review.
3. Practice by modifying the script to include additional reflection fields or change the output format.
