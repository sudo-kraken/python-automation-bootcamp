# Lesson 1: Continuous Improvement and Feedback Mechanisms

## Overview
In any ongoing project, regularly reviewing your progress is key to continuous improvement. This lesson shows you how to:
- Prompt for and collect details about your progress, challenges, and future improvement goals.
- Log these details into a file using real file I/O operations.
- Read back and review the logged information.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Progress Reporting:**  
  You will learn how to use Python to capture your current progress, record any challenges you encountered, and outline your improvement goals.
  
- **File Logging:**  
  The demonstration script writes your inputs to a log file (e.g., `progress_report.log`) so you can review your progress over time.
  
- **Interactive Feedback:**  
  This script runs in a loop, allowing you to enter multiple entries until you decide to exit.

## Objectives
- Build an interactive progress report tool.
- Learn to use file I/O operations to log and read data.
- Understand the value of regular self-assessment for continuous improvement.

## Instructions
1. Read the explanation above.
2. Run the `progress_report.py` script to see a live demonstration of progress reporting.
3. Practice by modifying the scriptâ€”for example, add additional fields or change the log format.
