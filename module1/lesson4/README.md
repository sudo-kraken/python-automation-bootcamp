# Lesson 4: Functions, Modules and Code Organisation

## Overview
In this lesson, you will learn how to organise your code with functions and modules. This lesson covers how to encapsulate logic into functions, import modules, and structure your code for reusability and maintainability.

## Objectives
- Understand the benefits of using functions.
- Learn to define and call functions.
- Organise your code into modules and packages.
- Adopt best practices for writing modular, maintainable code.

## Topics Covered
- Defining and using functions
- Function arguments, return values, and docstrings
- Organising code into modules
- Importing modules and using built-in functions

## Instructions
1. Review the sample code in the `examples` folder.
2. Complete the assignment in the `assignments` folder to practise writing functions and organising your code.
3. Ensure your code is modular and well-documented.
