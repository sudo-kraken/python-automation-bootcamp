# Practice Exercise: File Operations

## Objective
Practice reading from and writing to files using Python.

## Tasks
1. Create a new file named `file_exercise.py`.
2. In your script:
   - Open a text file (create one if it doesn't exist) and read its content.
   - Print the content to the console.
   - Append a new line of text to the file.
   - Read the file again and print the updated content.
3. Use try/except blocks to handle any errors that might occur.

This exercise will help you become comfortable with file input/output in Python.
