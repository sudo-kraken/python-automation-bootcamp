# Lesson 5: File Operations and Simple Automation Tasks

## Overview
Working with files is an essential skill for automating routine tasks. In this lesson, you will learn how to open, read from, and write to files in Python, along with basic error handling.

### Detailed Explanation
- **File Input/Output (I/O):**  
  File I/O involves reading data from a file and writing data to a file. This is useful for processing logs, data files, and configuration files.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  When working with files, errors (such as a missing file) can occur. Using try/except blocks allows your program to handle these errors gracefully.

## Objectives
- Learn how to open and read from files.
- Understand how to write to files.
- Practice basic error handling during file operations.

## Instructions
1. Read through the explanation above.
2. Run the `file_reader.py` example to see file operations in action.
3. Practice by writing your own script that reads from and writes to a file.
