# Practice Exercise: Variables and Basic Operations

## Objective
Practice declaring variables and performing arithmetic operations in Python.

## Tasks
1. Create a new file named `operations_exercise.py`.
2. In your script:
   - Declare variables for different data types (e.g., a string, an integer, a float, and a boolean).
   - Perform at least three arithmetic operations on numeric variables.
   - Print the results to the console.
3. Experiment by changing the values and observing the output.

This exercise will help you understand how data is stored and manipulated in Python.
