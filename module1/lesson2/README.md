# Lesson 2: Python Data Types, Variables & Basic Operations

## Overview
In this lesson, you'll learn about the basic building blocks of Python: data types and variables, and how to perform simple arithmetic operations.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Data Types:**  
  Python supports several data types:
  - **Strings:** Text data, e.g., "Hello".
  - **Integers:** Whole numbers, e.g., 10.
  - **Floats:** Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14.
  - **Booleans:** True or False values.

- **Variables:**  
  Variables store data values. For example, `name = "Alice"` assigns the string `"Alice"` to the variable `name`.

- **Arithmetic Operations:**  
  You can perform basic math operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numeric variables.

## Objectives
- Learn how to declare variables and assign different data types.
- Perform arithmetic operations and understand the results.
- Understand how to print and display variable values.

## Instructions
1. Read through the explanation above.
2. Run the `basic_operations.py` example to see how variables and arithmetic operations work.
3. Practice by creating your own script to experiment with different values and operations.
