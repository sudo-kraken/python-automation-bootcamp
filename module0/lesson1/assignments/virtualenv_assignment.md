# Practice Exercise: Virtual Environment Setup

## Objective
Practice creating a Python virtual environment using `venv` and explore `pyenv` for managing multiple Python versions.

## Tasks
1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   - Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the command:  
     `python -m venv myenv`
   - This will create a folder named `myenv` containing an isolated Python environment.

2. **Activate Your Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows:  
     `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux:  
     `source myenv/bin/activate`

3. **Explore pyenv (Optional):**
   - If you have pyenv installed, try running:  
     `pyenv versions`
   - Optionally, install and switch to a different Python version using pyenv.

4. **Practice:**
   - Experiment with creating and activating environments.
   - Note any differences you observe when using different Python versions (if you try pyenv).

This exercise is for your own practiceâ€”work through the steps until you feel comfortable with these tools.
