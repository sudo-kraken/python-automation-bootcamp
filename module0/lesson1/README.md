# Lesson 1: Python Environments and Virtualisation

## Overview
When working on Python projects, itâ€™s crucial to isolate your project's dependencies. This lesson explains:

- **venv:**  
  A built-in module for creating isolated Python environments.

- **virtualenv:**  
  An alternative tool for creating virtual environments (works similarly to venv).

- **pyenv:**  
  A tool to manage and switch between multiple Python versions.

### Why Is This Important?
- **Isolation:** Keeps project libraries separate to avoid conflicts.
- **Reproducibility:** Makes it easier to recreate your environment on different machines.
- **Flexibility:** Allows you to test your code with different Python versions.

## Objectives
- Learn how to create and activate a virtual environment using `venv`.
- Understand the basics of managing Python versions with `pyenv`.

## Instructions
1. Read through this explanation.
2. Run the provided example script (`virtualenv_setup.py`) to see how a virtual environment is created.
3. As a practice exercise, try creating and activating your own virtual environment using the steps below.
