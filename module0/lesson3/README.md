# Lesson 3: Coding Standards and Linting

## Overview
Writing clean and readable code is essential for any programming project. Python's PEP8 is the official style guide that outlines best practices, and **flake8** is a tool that checks your code for compliance with these guidelines and potential errors.

### What You Will Learn
- **PEP8:** The style guide for Python, which covers naming conventions, indentation, line length, and more.
- **flake8:** A tool to automatically check your Python code for style issues and errors.
- How to run flake8 from the command line—or programmatically—to check a script for compliance with PEP8.

### Demonstration Focus
In this lesson, you’ll see a demonstration of how to run flake8 on a Python script. The provided example:
- Creates a temporary Python file with some deliberate style issues.
- Uses the `subprocess` module to run flake8 on that file.
- Prints out the flake8 output, showing you how issues are reported.

*Note:* To try this demonstration, ensure that flake8 is installed in your environment (`pip install flake8`).

## Objectives
- Understand why coding standards (PEP8) matter.
- Learn how to use flake8 to check your code for style issues.
- Get a practical demonstration of running flake8 from within a Python script.

## Instructions
1. Read the explanation above.
2. Run the `pep8_flake8_setup.py` example to see a live demonstration of flake8 in action.
3. As a practice exercise, consider running flake8 on your own scripts from the command line.
