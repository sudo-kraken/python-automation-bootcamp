# mentorship_project.py
"""
This script simulates a mentorship session for an advanced automation project.

It performs the following:
1. Simulates a mentor reviewing the project by executing a command (using subprocess).
2. Simulates implementing feedback by re-running parts of the project.
3. Uses real system commands to demonstrate iterative improvements.

For example, it runs a command to display the current directory contents (as a stand-in for code review)
and then simulates a configuration update.
