# Practice Exercise: Mentorship & Collaborative Implementation

## Objective
Practice simulating a mentorship session by integrating iterative feedback into your automation project.

## Tasks
1. Open the `mentorship_project.py` script.
2. Modify the script to add another simulated feedback step (for example, re-running tests or updating logs).
3. Experiment with changing the commands (e.g., using a different system command) to simulate various aspects of the mentorship process.
4. Run your modified script and observe the changes.

This exercise will help you understand how to iterate on your project with feedback.
