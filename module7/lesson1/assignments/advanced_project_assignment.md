# Practice Exercise: Advanced Project Kick-Off

## Objective
Practice integrating multiple automation components into one project.

## Tasks
1. Open the `advanced_project_setup.py` script.
2. Extend the script by:
   - Adding a new stage to the CI/CD simulation (for example, a static code analysis stage using a command like `flake8 --version`).
   - Modifying the API integration to fetch and display additional fields.
   - Experimenting with different network commands or simulating a fallback if network automation fails.
3. Run your modified script to observe how the integrated process works.

Work through this exercise to enhance your understanding of building a complex automation workflow.
