# Module 4: DevOps/NetOps and Automation Tools

Welcome to Module 4! In this module, you will explore how modern automation integrates DevOps (software development and deployment) with NetOps (network operations). You will learn about:

1. **Overview of DevOps and NetOps in Automation:**  
   Understand the principles behind automating build, test, deployment, and network configuration processes. In real environments, tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and network management systems are usedâ€”but here we simulate these processes using actual system commands.

2. **Building a CI/CD Pipeline for Automation:**  
   Learn the fundamental stages of a CI/CD pipeline and see them executed by calling real commands. This includes pulling code, running tests, and deploying applications using system utilities.

3. **Integrating Network Automation into DevOps Workflows:**  
   Discover how network automation tasks (like executing configuration commands) can be combined with DevOps pipelines. The demonstration uses the Netmiko library to illustrate how you would connect to a network device and run commands. (Note: To run this for real, you must replace placeholder values with actual device details.)

Each lesson includes detailed explanations, demonstration scripts that run actual commands (or make real API calls), and practice exercises so you can learn by doing.

**Note:** When using tools like Netmiko in production, secure credential management is essential. The examples here use placeholders for demonstration only.
