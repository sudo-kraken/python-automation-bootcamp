# Practice Exercise: Extend the Interactive AI Tool Simulation

## Objective
Enhance the interactive AI tool simulation by adding new features.

## Tasks
1. Open the `ai_exercise.py` script.
2. Modify the script to:
   - Add a timestamp to each logged interaction (if not already present).
   - Allow the user to clear the log file with a special command (e.g., "clear").
   - Customize the output format of the AI response.
3. Run your updated script and test the new features by interacting with the tool.

Work through this exercise to practice integrating API calls, interactive input, and file logging in Python.
