# Practice Exercise: Explore AI Dev Tools Simulation

## Objective
Practice interacting with the simulated AI tool to see dynamic responses based on your input.

## Tasks
1. Open the `ai_overview.py` script.
2. Run the script and enter different queries to observe various AI suggestions.
3. Modify the script to change how the AI suggestion is formatted (e.g., add a prefix or a timestamp).
4. Optionally, change the API endpoint to fetch different types of data.

Work through this exercise to understand the concept of dynamic AI assistance.
