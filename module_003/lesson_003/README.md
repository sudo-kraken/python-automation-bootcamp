# Lesson 3: Integration Project â€“ APIs & Network Automation

## Overview
This lesson combines the concepts you learned in Lessons 1 and 2. In real-world scenarios, you might use data fetched from an API to drive network automation tasks. In this integration project, you will see how API data can be used to influence network commands.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Integration of Concepts:**  
  You will retrieve data from an API (for example, configuration details) and then use that data to execute a command on a network device.
  
- **Real-World Applications:**  
  This kind of integration can help automate tasks like updating device configurations based on dynamic data from a central system.
  
- **Note:**  
  The provided script uses placeholder values and simulated behavior. For actual automation, ensure you have the appropriate API endpoints and device access.

## Objectives
- Combine API interfacing and network automation in a single script.
- Learn how to pass data from an API to a network automation function.
- Understand how to structure an integrated Python project.

## Instructions
1. Read through the explanation above.
2. Run the `integration_project.py` demonstration script to see an example of integration.
3. Practice by modifying the script:
   - Change the API endpoint or parse different data.
   - Adjust the network command based on the API data.
