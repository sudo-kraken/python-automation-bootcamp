# Lesson 1: Interfacing with APIs Using the Requests Library

## Overview
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software systems to communicate with each other. In this lesson, you will learn:
- What a RESTful API is and the basics of HTTP methods.
- How to use Python's `requests` library to send HTTP requests and receive data.
- How to parse JSON responses and extract useful information.

### Detailed Explanation
- **RESTful APIs:**  
  RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations. Data is typically exchanged in JSON format.
  
- **The requests Library:**  
  The `requests` library simplifies making HTTP requests in Python. You can easily send a GET request to an API endpoint, check the response status, and parse JSON data.

## Objectives
- Learn to send a GET request to a public API.
- Understand how to check the response status and parse the JSON data.
- Familiarise yourself with basic error handling in API requests.

## Instructions
1. Read the explanation above.
2. Run the `api_requests.py` demonstration script to see how to fetch data from an API.
3. Practice by modifying the script to retrieve data from a different public API or extract different fields from the JSON response.
