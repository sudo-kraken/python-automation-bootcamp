# Practice Exercise: Automating Network Devices with Netmiko

## Objective
Practice writing a Python script that uses Netmiko to automate tasks on a network device. If you do not have access to an actual device, simulate the process by modifying the demonstration script.

## Tasks
1. Create a new file named `netmiko_exercise.py`.
2. In your script:
   - Define a function to establish a connection to a network device using Netmiko.
   - Execute a command (e.g., "show ip interface brief") and print the output.
   - Ensure you use try/except blocks to handle potential errors.
3. Experiment by changing the command or using simulated responses if you do not have access to a real device.

Work through this exercise to gain practical experience with network automation.
