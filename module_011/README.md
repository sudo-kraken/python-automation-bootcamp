# Module 11: Automating Everyday Tasks with Python

Welcome to Bonus Module 11! In this module, you'll build practical skills by automating common daily tasks using Python. The lessons focus on using Python to interact with the operating system and to process text data. By the end of Module 11, you should be comfortable writing scripts that perform file operations and handle textual information automatically, saving you time on routine chores.

1. **OS Commands and File Automation:**  
   Learn to execute system commands from Python and automate simple file management tasks. We'll use Python's standard library modules (like os and subprocess) to run shell commands (e.g., pinging hosts) and to manipulate files and directories programmatically.

2. **Text Parsing and Regex:**  
   Discover how to read and parse text files effectively. You'll practise using Python's text handling and the re (regex) module to find patterns in log files or configurations, enabling you to quickly extract important information or detect issues from large text outputs.

3. **Batch File Renaming:**  
   Master techniques for renaming multiple files in one go. This lesson shows how to write a Python script to systematically rename a batch of files (for example, adding prefixes or suffixes to network configuration files), which is much faster and less error-prone than renaming each file manually.

Each lesson provides a detailed explanation of the concepts, a demonstration script you can run interactively, and a practice exercise to reinforce your understanding.
