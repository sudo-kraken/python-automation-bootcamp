# Practice Exercise: Text Parsing and Regex

## Objective
Complete the following tasks to practise reading, parsing, and extracting information from text files using `Python` and regular expressions.

## Tasks
1. **Basic Log Scanner:**

   - Write a `Python` script that asks the user for a log file path and a keyword.
   - Search the log file line by line for the keyword and print matching lines to the console.
   - Display the total number of matches found at the end.

2. **Regex Pattern Searcher:**

   - Modify the basic log scanner to accept a regular expression pattern instead of a fixed keyword.
   - Highlight or indicate lines that match the regex pattern.

3. **Save Matching Lines to a New File:**

   - Update the script so that all matching lines are saved to a new file (e.g., `matches_output.txt`).
   - Include a header in the output file showing the pattern used and the number of matches.

Save your scripts in the `examples/` folder for this lesson.

This exercise will help you become confident with file reading, searching using regular expressions, and handling file output in `Python`.
