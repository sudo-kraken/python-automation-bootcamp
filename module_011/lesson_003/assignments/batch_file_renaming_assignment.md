# Practice Exercise: Batch File Renaming

## Objective
Complete the following tasks to practise automating the renaming of multiple files in a directory using `Python`.

## Tasks
1. **Prefix Adder:**

   - Create a `Python` script that asks the user for a directory and a prefix string.
   - Add the prefix to the beginning of each filename in the directory.

2. **Suffix Adder:**

   - Modify the script to optionally add a suffix to filenames instead of a prefix.
   - Ask the user whether they want to apply a prefix or a suffix before proceeding.

3. **Selective Renamer:**

   - Extend the script to only rename files with a specific extension (e.g., `.txt` or `.cfg`).
   - Ask the user for the extension to filter by.

4. **Dry Run Mode (Bonus):**

   - Add an option to simulate the renaming without actually changing files (showing what would happen).

Save your scripts in the `examples/` folder for this lesson.

This exercise will help you become comfortable working with the filesystem, performing batch operations, and adding user interaction to your scripts.
