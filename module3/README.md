# Module 3: Interfacing with APIs and Network Automation

Welcome to Module 3! In this module, you'll learn how to extend your Python skills by interfacing with external services and automating network tasks. We cover two main areas:

1. **Interfacing with APIs Using the Requests Library:**  
   - Understand what a RESTful API is and how it works.
   - Learn how to use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests, retrieve data (usually in JSON format), and process the response.
   - See practical examples of fetching data from public APIs.

2. **Automating Network Devices with Netmiko:**  
   - Discover how Python can automate tasks on network devices.
   - Learn the basics of the Netmiko library to establish SSH connections to network devices.
   - Understand that real-world usage requires valid device credentials and access; this example uses placeholders for demonstration.

3. **Integration Project â€“ APIs & Network Automation:**  
   - Combine the concepts of API interfacing and network automation.
   - Learn how API data could drive automation tasks on network devices.
   - Note: The integration example is for demonstration only and uses simulated data or placeholder values.

Each lesson includes comprehensive explanations, demonstration scripts to illustrate best practices, and practice exercises for you to work through at your own pace.
