# Practice Exercise: Interfacing with APIs

## Objective
Practice fetching and processing data from a public API using Python's requests library.

## Tasks
1. Create a new file named `api_exercise.py`.
2. In your script:
   - Use the requests library to send a GET request to a public API (you may use the jsonplaceholder API or another public API).
   - Check if the request is successful.
   - Parse the JSON response and extract at least two pieces of information.
   - Print the extracted information in a readable format.
3. Experiment by changing the API endpoint or extracting different fields from the JSON data.

This exercise will help you become comfortable with making HTTP requests and processing JSON data.
