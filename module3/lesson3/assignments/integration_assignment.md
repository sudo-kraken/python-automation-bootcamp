# Practice Exercise: Integration of APIs and Network Automation

## Objective
Practice integrating API data with network automation in a single Python script.

## Tasks
1. Create a new file named `integration_exercise.py`.
2. In your script:
   - Use the requests library to fetch data from a public API (e.g., the jsonplaceholder API).
   - Parse the JSON response to extract at least one piece of useful data.
   - Based on the extracted data, decide which network command to execute.
   - Use a function that simulates or actually connects to a network device using Netmiko and executes the chosen command.
3. Experiment with different API endpoints or simulated data to see how the integration can be modified.

This exercise will help you understand how different components can work together in a real-world automation scenario.
