# Lesson 1: Overview of AI Dev Tools and Their Role in Automation

## Overview
AI dev tools can significantly assist in code development by generating suggestions, debugging code, or optimizing logic. In this lesson, you'll learn:
- The core concept of AI-assisted coding.
- How dynamic responses can be simulated using live API calls.
- How these simulated responses might help you in your coding process.

### Detailed Explanation
Real AI tools require access to sophisticated APIs and credentials. Here, we simulate an AI response by fetching a random quote from the Quotable API. The fetched quote represents an "AI suggestion" that changes with each query.

## Objectives
- Learn to use Python's `requests` library to interact with a live API.
- Experience a dynamic, interactive example that simulates AI assistance.
- Understand how such tools can be integrated into your workflow.

## Instructions
1. Read the explanation above.
2. Run the `ai_overview.py` script to see the simulation.
3. Experiment by modifying the prompt or API endpoint to observe different responses.
