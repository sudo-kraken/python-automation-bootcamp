# Module 6: Introduction to AI Dev Tools and Practical Exercises

Welcome to Module 6! In this module, you'll explore how AI development tools can assist with coding and automation. While commercial AI tools (such as GitHub Copilot or OpenAI Codex) require complex setups and API keys, here we simulate AI assistance using a public API. This simulation demonstrates how dynamic responses can be integrated into your development workflow.

**What You'll Learn:**

1. **Overview of AI Dev Tools:**  
   - Understand the role of AI in helping with code generation, debugging, and optimization.
   - See a demonstration that fetches live data from the Quotable API to simulate an AI suggestion.

2. **Practical Exercises with AI Dev Tools:**  
   - Build an interactive session where you can enter multiple queries and receive dynamic responses.
   - Log each interaction to a file for review.
   - Practice modifying and extending the simulation with additional features.

*Note:* In real-world use, you would interact with a dedicated AI API. For this exercise, we use the Quotable API (https://api.adviceslip.com/advice) to simulate dynamic AI responses.
