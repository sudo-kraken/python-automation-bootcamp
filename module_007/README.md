# Module 7: Advanced Projects & Mentorship Phase

Welcome to Module 7! In this module you will take your skills to the next level by working on an advanced project and collaborating with a mentor. This module is divided into two lessons:

1. **Advanced Project Kick-Off:**  
   Plan and initiate an integrated automation project that combines API interfacing, CI/CD simulation, and network automation.

2. **Mentorship & Collaborative Project Implementation:**  
   Simulate a mentorship session where you review your project, receive feedback, and iteratively improve your solution.

Each lesson includes detailed explanations, demonstration scripts that execute real commands or API calls, and practice exercises for you to modify and extend as you learn.
