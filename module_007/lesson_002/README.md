# Lesson 2: Mentorship & Collaborative Project Implementation

## Overview
In this lesson, you will simulate a collaborative session with a mentor to review and improve your advanced project. The demonstration script shows how mentor feedback might be integrated into your workflow by running additional commands and making iterative changes.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Mentor Feedback Simulation:**  
  The script simulates a mentor reviewing your project progress and suggesting improvements.
- **Implementing Feedback:**  
  The demonstration shows how to incorporate feedback by re-running parts of the project (for example, updating configurations or re-running tests).
- **Practical Integration:**  
  You will see an actual execution of commands that simulate a code review or update process.

## Objectives
- Understand how to integrate feedback into your project.
- Learn to modify your automation workflow based on collaborative input.
- Experience a simulated mentorship session using real command execution.

## Instructions
1. Read the explanation above.
2. Run the `mentorship_project.py` script to observe a simulated mentorship session.
3. Practice by modifying the script to simulate additional feedback or iterative improvements.
