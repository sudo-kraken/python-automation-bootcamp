# Practice Exercise: Enhance the Monitoring & Troubleshooting Tool

## Objective
Practice building and extending a monitoring and troubleshooting tool.

## Tasks
1. Open the `monitoring.py` script.
2. Modify the script to:
   - Include an additional command that checks system uptime (e.g., using the 'uptime' command on Unix).
   - Allow the user to specify how many lines of the log to display.
   - Format the output to include headings for each section.
3. Run your updated script to verify that your modifications work as intended.

This exercise will help you deepen your understanding of system monitoring and basic troubleshooting.
