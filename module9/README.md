# Module 9: Deployment, Monitoring, and Troubleshooting

Welcome to Module 9! In this module, you'll learn how to take your automation projects into a production-like environment. Rather than a capstone presentation, this module focuses on:

1. **Deployment & Production Automation:**  
   - Learn how to deploy your automation scripts into a production-like setting.
   - See real system commands in action (using subprocess to execute commands such as file listings, service simulations, etc.).
   - Understand how to verify that deployment tasks have been executed successfully.

2. **Monitoring & Troubleshooting:**  
   - Learn how to monitor your deployed scripts and services.
   - Use actual system commands to check running processes and view log files.
   - Practice basic troubleshooting steps to identify and resolve common issues.

Each lesson provides detailed explanations, demonstration scripts that run real commands, and practice exercises for you to modify and extend as you gain confidence.
