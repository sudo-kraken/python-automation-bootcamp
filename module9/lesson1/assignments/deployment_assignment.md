# Practice Exercise: Enhance the Deployment Simulation

## Objective
Practice modifying the deployment simulation script to better suit your deployment scenario.

## Tasks
1. Open the `deployment.py` script.
2. Modify the script to:
   - Add a new deployment stage, such as simulating a file copy operation (e.g., using `cp` or `copy`).
   - Change the deployment message or add more detailed output.
   - Optionally, add error handling to simulate rollback actions.
3. Run your updated script to see the changes in action.

Work through this exercise to gain a deeper understanding of how to integrate system commands into your deployment process.
