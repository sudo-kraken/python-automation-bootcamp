# Lesson 1: Deployment & Production Automation

## Overview
Deploying your automation projects means moving them from development into a production-like environment. In this lesson, you'll learn:
- How to simulate deployment tasks using real system commands.
- How to check that your deployment steps have executed successfully.
- Techniques to integrate file operations and subprocess commands into your deployment workflow.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Deployment Simulation:**  
  Instead of just printing messages, we’ll execute actual system commands (e.g., listing directory contents, echoing messages, or copying files) using Python’s `subprocess` module.
- **Production Checks:**  
  You’ll see how to verify deployment status by running real commands (like `git status` or `ls` to list files).
- **Practical Considerations:**  
  In a real environment, you might deploy files to a server, start services, or use orchestration tools. Here, we simulate these steps with commands that work on your local machine.

## Objectives
- Learn to run system commands from within Python.
- Simulate a multi-step deployment process.
- Understand how to verify that each deployment stage has executed properly.

## Instructions
1. Read the explanation above.
2. Run the `deployment.py` script to observe the simulated deployment process.
3. Experiment by modifying the commands or adding new steps.
