# Practice Exercise: DevOps and NetOps Overview

## Objective
Practice simulating a DevOps/NetOps process using real system commands.

## Tasks
1. Run the `devops_overview.py` script to observe the simulated process.
2. Modify the script to add an additional stage (for example, a rollback or logging stage).
3. Experiment with replacing some commands (e.g., use `ls -l` to list files) to simulate different operational steps.

This exercise helps you understand the flow and integration of DevOps and NetOps processes using actual commands.
