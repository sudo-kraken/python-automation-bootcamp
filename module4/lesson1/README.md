# Lesson 1: Overview of DevOps and NetOps in Automation

## Overview
DevOps and NetOps merge the processes of software development and network operations using automation. In this lesson, you'll see an actual demonstration of some key processes by running system commands.

### Detailed Explanation
- **DevOps:**  
  Automates the build, testing, and deployment of applications.
- **NetOps:**  
  Uses automation to manage network devices (e.g., updating configurations).
  
In this demonstration, we use actual system commands (via Pythonâ€™s subprocess module) to simulate:
- Building a project.
- Running tests.
- Deploying an application.
- Updating network configurations.

*Note:* In real scenarios, these steps would involve more complex tools and processes.

## Objectives
- Understand the high-level flow of a DevOps/NetOps process.
- See how real system commands can be integrated into automation workflows.
- Learn by modifying and extending the demonstration.

## Instructions
1. Read the explanation above.
2. Run the `devops_overview.py` script to observe a simulated process using real command execution.
3. Experiment with the script by adding, removing, or modifying commands.
