# Practice Exercise: CI/CD Pipeline Simulation

## Objective
Practice simulating a CI/CD pipeline using real system commands.

## Tasks
1. Run the `ci_cd_pipeline.py` script to observe the simulated pipeline.
2. Modify the script to add an additional stage (e.g., a static code analysis stage using a command like `flake8 --version`).
3. Experiment with adjusting the commands to simulate different scenarios (for instance, running `ls -l` to list directory contents as part of a build step).

This exercise will help you understand the flow of a CI/CD pipeline using actual command execution.
