# Lesson 2: Data Structures â€“ Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries

## Overview
Data structures are fundamental for storing and organizing data. In this lesson, you'll learn about:
- **Lists:** Ordered, mutable sequences.
- **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable sequences.
- **Sets:** Unordered collections of unique items.
- **Dictionaries:** Collections of key-value pairs.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Lists:**  
  Use lists to store sequences of items that can be changed (e.g., adding or removing elements).
  
- **Tuples:**  
  Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
  
- **Sets:**  
  Sets automatically remove duplicate items and allow for operations like union and intersection.
  
- **Dictionaries:**  
  Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, making it easy to retrieve data based on a unique key.

## Objectives
- Learn to create and manipulate lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
- Understand when to use each data structure.

## Instructions
1. Read through the explanation above.
2. Run the `data_structures.py` example to see these concepts demonstrated.
3. Practice by writing your own script that creates and manipulates these data structures.
