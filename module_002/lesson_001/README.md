# Lesson 1: Interactive Python and Exception Handling

## Overview
Interacting with users is a key part of many programs. In this lesson, you will learn how to:
- Use the `input()` function to get user input.
- Convert user input to the appropriate data type.
- Use try/except blocks to handle errors gracefully.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Interactive Input:**  
  The `input()` function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter data. This data is returned as a string.
  
- **Exception Handling:**  
  Sometimes, user input might not be what you expect (for example, entering letters when a number is required). Using try/except blocks helps you manage these errors without crashing your program.

## Objectives
- Learn to prompt the user for input.
- Convert input to a numeric value and handle conversion errors.
- Use exception handling to provide user-friendly error messages.

## Instructions
1. Read through this explanation.
2. Run the `interactive_input.py` example to see these concepts in action.
3. Practice by writing your own script that prompts for user input and handles errors.
