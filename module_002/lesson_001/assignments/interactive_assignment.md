# Practice Exercise: Interactive Input and Exception Handling

## Objective
Practice using interactive input and exception handling in Python.

## Tasks
1. Create a new file named `interactive_exercise.py`.
2. In your script:
   - Prompt the user to enter their name and age.
   - Convert the age to an integer and handle any conversion errors using a try/except block.
   - Print a personalized greeting that includes the user's name and age.
3. Experiment with entering both valid and invalid inputs to see how your program handles errors.

Work through this exercise to become comfortable with interactive input and error handling.
