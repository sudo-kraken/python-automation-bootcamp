# Lesson 3: Building a Command-Line Utility

## Overview
Command-line utilities allow users to interact with your programs via the terminal. In this lesson, you'll learn how to build a simple command-line tool using Python's argparse module.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Command-Line Arguments:**  
  These are inputs provided to your program when it is run from the terminal. They allow users to pass parameters to control how the program behaves.
  
- **argparse Module:**  
  argparse is a standard Python module that makes it easy to write user-friendly command-line interfaces. It handles parsing command-line arguments and generates help messages automatically.

## Objectives
- Learn how to define and parse command-line arguments.
- Create a script that takes user input from the command line and uses it to control the program's behavior.
- Understand how to use argparse to make your script user-friendly.

## Instructions
1. Read through the explanation above.
2. Run the `cli_tool.py` example to see how a basic command-line utility works.
3. Practice by writing your own command-line tool that performs a simple task based on the input arguments.
