# Practice Exercise: Build Your Own Practical Challenge

## Objective
Practice integrating multiple automation components into one script.

## Tasks
1. Open the `practical_challenge.py` script.
2. Extend the script by adding a new option (for example, a third option that simulates file operations or another automation task).
3. Modify the API integration part to fetch additional fields or use a different public API.
4. Experiment with the network automation part by adjusting the command or simulating alternative outputs.
5. Run your modified script to see how the integrated process works.

Work through this exercise to enhance your ability to combine different automation techniques into one cohesive tool.
