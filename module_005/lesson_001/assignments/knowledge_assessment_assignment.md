# Practice Exercise: Enhance the Knowledge Assessment Quiz

## Objective
Practice working with interactive input by extending the knowledge assessment quiz.

## Tasks
1. Open the `knowledge_assessment.py` script.
2. Add at least one new question (for example, a question about Python data types or file operations).
3. Ensure that your new question is integrated into the scoring system.
4. Run the updated quiz to test the new question.

Work through this exercise to deepen your familiarity with interactive scripting in Python.
